       The Captain of each Team must get in touch with the opposing Captain
       to discuss the date in which they want to have their match(on what date both rosters can make it).
       Captains should check with their starters of their roster to make sure that they can make the date decided upon.
       Once decided, those Captains must get ahold of BLOODSLASH in discord and let him know the playdate so that Admins can be prepared to spectate for that match.
       Teams will have 1 week to complete their 1st round bracket matchups. 2nd round Tournament dates will be set once all 1st round matchups are completed. 
       Captains should all be in the <a href='https://discord.gg/upperhand'>UpperHand discord</a> and should be under alias as shown on the list of Teams below. 
       Each Captain needs to dm one another according to matchups. The 1st round matchups MUST play their match between October 1st-October 8th, if a playdate cannot be decided upon then they have 3 days to play the match(October 11th) or both teams forfeit their match.

      <h4 className='text-center fw-bold'>YOU NEED EOD EDITION IN ORDER TO PLAY OFFLINE COOP AND PARTICIPATE!</h4>
      <p className='fw-semibold'>Team Size:</p>
      <p>5 with one sub(6 total), if you have more than 1 sub then that is okay.</p>
      <p className='fw-semibold'>Format:</p>
      <p>Double Elimination setup in NCAA March Madness style brackets.
         Best 2/3 raids per round. Each Team will start off once on defense and once on offense. 
         The Team on the Top of their bracket will start off on Offense first, and the team on Bottom; Defense. 
         If each team wins 1 raid a piece then it will go into a tiebreaker with a coinflip that the winning Captain calls.  
         If the Captain wins the coinflip, they get to decide whether to play on Defense or Offense for the final raid. 
         Otherwise, the opposing Captain gets the choice. Once a team loses 2 raids to the opposing team, they will be put into the losers bracket with the same format. 
         If they lose 2 raids again to their next opponent then they are eliminated from the Tournament. 
         </p>
         <p className='fw-semibold'>Goal:</p>
         <p>
         There will be one team that plays on Defense and one team that plays on Offense. 
         One player from the Defending team will bring in a couch bag and place it on the table in managers office.  
         The attacking team must go for the couch bag that is held on the table in the managers office and try to escape with it and reach the sewer conduit extract. 
         The Defending team must try at all cost to Defend this. The game ends when all opponents are eliminated on one team or the attacking team reaches the sewer conduit extract with the couch bag(Must be within the squared in room of sewer). 
         If, in the event that the timer reaches 0:00 and there are still players alive on both teams, the Defense automatically wins the raid.
         </p>
         <p className='fw-semibold'>Region:</p>
         <p>North America Only</p>
         <p className='fw-semibold'>Timer:</p>

         <p>Raiders will spawn naturally on their own, usually 10 minutes or so into raid.(Do not hit buttons to spawn any raiders otherwise)</p>
         <p className='fw-semibold'>Spawn:</p>
         <p>Both teams will spawn together and immediately go to their respective locations
          (Offense must immediately go to basement to the location shown below,
           Defense must setup Defensive positions around the upper 2 floors and drop the 'couch' bag onto the table in managers office). 
           They will have 5 minutes to do so.
         </p>
         <p className='fw-semibold'>Offense:</p>
         <p>The Offensive team will start off in the basement in this specific location(All Offensive players MUST be in this room) and will begin their ascent once the clock hits 30:00.
         </p>
            <img></img>
         <p>Their ultimate goal is to grab the Couch bag in the managers office on the table. 
        </p>
        <img></img>
        <br></br>
        <img></img>
        <p>They must then either reach the sewer conduit extract with it or they can win by eliminating all of the opposing team. 
          If the "couch" carrier reaches the squared in area of the sewer shown below then that team is the winner of that raid.
        </p>
        <img></img>
        <p className='fw-semibold'>Defence:</p>
        <p>At the start of the round, the Defensive Team will place the couch bag on the table inside of the managers office and close the door. 
          THE BAG MUST REMAIN EMPTY(Dot not fill the bag with anything!) 
          They will then setup Defensive positions all around the upper 2 floors strategically in order to counteract the Offense from taking and capturing the bag.
        </p>
        <img></img>
        <p>
        The Defensive team will at all costs protect the couch bag from being taken and extracted by the Offensive team. 
        They are limited to the top 2 floors of LABS unless the couch bag is taken; in which they can pursue the "couch" carrier onto any floor. 
        Defensive players are allowed to roam anywhere once the couch bag has left the managers office.
            <br></br>
            If the couch bag is taken by an Offensive Team member and he is killed,
             the Defensive Team is NOT allowed to pick up the couch bag at any time(even to take it back to the managers office). 
             They must setup defensive positions around the bag in the place that it was dropped.
