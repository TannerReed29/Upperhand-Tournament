      <p className='my-2 py-2' id='rules-text' >
      Tourney Dates: First round begins on October 1st, 2022.
       The Captain of each Team must get in touch with the opposing Captain
       to discuss the date in which they want to have their match(on what date both rosters can make it).
       Captains should check with their starters of their roster to make sure that they can make the date decided upon.
       Once decided, those Captains must get ahold of BLOODSLASH in discord and let him know the playdate so that Admins can be prepared to spectate for that match.
       Teams will have 1 week to complete their 1st round bracket matchups. 2nd round Tournament dates will be set once all 1st round matchups are completed. 
       Captains should all be in the UpperHand discord at discord.gg/upperhand and should be under alias as shown on the list of Teams below. 
       Each Captain needs to dm one another according to matchups. The 1st round matchups MUST play their match between October 1st-October 8th, if a playdate cannot be decided upon then they have 3 days to play the match(October 11th) or both teams forfeit their match.
